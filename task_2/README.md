# CRUD API

## Setup

Requires Python 3.8 or Later. I also used Mysql 5.7 for this project.

I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### To Create a virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment using `pipenv`

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will create and install all the require dependecies

##### To Start the environment for Windows Users

```
pipenv shell
```

#### Running Mysql Database on Linux

`Note`: If your running the code locally, you need to input the database details in `db.py`
user = "<the database user>"
password = "<the specific users password>"
host = "localhost or the where the database is hosted"
database = "<the database name>"

- This is the ERD for the database

To `start` your server use

```
 sudo service mysql start
```

After starting you can then create the database you will need for this project by entering this commands

```
mysql -u<your mysql user name> -p<your mysql password for this specific user>
```
